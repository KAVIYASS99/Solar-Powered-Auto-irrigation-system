The project was done as a part of Internal hackathon conducted in our college. The proposed solution was to convert solar energy obtained by pv cells to electrical energy to operate the pump.
Thus the irrigation process is automated by the use of microcontroller and moisture sensor and it is programmed in such a way that the motor turns on and off according to the moistiure values.
