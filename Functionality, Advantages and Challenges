# Functionality
Photovoltaic (PV) cells are used to extract solar energy, which is then boosted by a boost converter to match the required electrical voltage. An inverter is employed to convert the DC voltage to AC voltage, enabling the operation of a water pump. Thus, battery is used to store the energy.
A microcontroller receives input from a moisture sensor and operates the water pump using the converted electrical energy. Additionally, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor is connected to the microcontroller, allowing a servo motor to adjust the orientation of the solar panel towards the direction with the most sunlight.

# Advantages
Environment friendly
The energy can be stored and used for later purpose
pv cells have larger life span for about 25 years

# Challenges
The accuracy decreased because we did not use actual solar panels and solar lights.
